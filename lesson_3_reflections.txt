When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would say when you have an office computer but you want to also work on the project on your laptop. 
Or if you are working on a team and the different members need to access the work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you pull changes manually, then you know when you are ready to synce your personal repository with the remote. 
Otherwise if Git automatically stay's up to date, something can either be pulled and overwrite the same file that your are working on on your Git or add extra files that you don't account for and crash your program by including the extra files.

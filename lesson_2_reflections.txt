What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, a whole new directory is created. 
It starts off brand new. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is not a full commit, but rather an almost commit area. Versus the repository when everything is a snapshot. or a working directory where both the hidden and unhidden files can be seen but may be committed yet.
